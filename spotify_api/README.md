# Get Spotify Songs
To link the doremus id works with real songs, we are trying to use both Youtube and Spotify API.
We wrote a script that should run for about 30 hours to link Soptify tracks with Doremus works.

## Before all, it's necessary to install Python and the library spotipy



## The instruction to run the script are reported here:
### 1) Download the zip file "spotify_api.zip" at this link:
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2m64YbMzInoLWVlU2pOX1owbVk]
### 2) Unzip the folder
### 3)Using the terminal, go inside the unzipped directory and type:

```
python spotify_getVideos.py Compositions_Doremus.csv
```
