To link find paths between works and POIs, we are trying to use Relfinder both for Dbpedia and Wikidata.
The script that performs this action is called `SubProc.py`. It can perform different operation depending
on the command line arguments passed to.
It takes as input file one or two files in the folder `input_files` and it writes new files in the folder `output_files` 
that is created when the script runs for the first time. Then it is possible to stop running and continue the execution
